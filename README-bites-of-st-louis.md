# Project Title

Bites of St. Louis – an app to quickly track down St. Louis restaurants you'll love. 

You've just arrived in St. Louis for a conference, or you just moved here, and you're hungry. You heard there's some great food here, but you have no idea where to find it. Imagine if you could pull up an app on your phone and search for your favorite food, the nearest restaurants to where you're staying, or the best vegan options around?

Bites of St. Louis is the app you need. Bites of St. Louis lists 100 of the best restaurants in St. Louis by category, neighborhod and price. Search to find what you're looking for, or use the map to locate the nearest restaurants to you at a glance.
